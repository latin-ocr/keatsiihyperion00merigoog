12 HYPERION.

While fate seem'd strangled in my nervous graspi

But it is so; and Ι am smother’d up,

And buried from all god-like exercise

Os influence benign on planets pale,

Of admonitions to the winds and seas,

Os peaceful sway above man’s harvesting, 110
Os all those acts which Deity supreme

Doth ease its heart of love in. I am gone

Away from my own bosom 3 I have left ·

My strong identity, my real sels,

Somewhere between the throne, and where I sit ·
Here on this spot of earth. Search, Thea, search
Open thine eyes eterne, and sphere them round

Upon all space 3 space starr'd, and lorn of light 3
Space region'd with life-air, and barren void 3

Spaces of fire, and all the yawn os hell. 120
Search, Thea, search! and tell me is thou seest

Α certain shape or shadow‚ making way

With wings or chariot fierce, to repossess

Α heaven he lost erewhile: it must, it must

Be os ripe progress: Saturn must be king!

Yes, there must be a golden victory 3

There must be gods thrown down, and trumpets ΜοινῐιΙΙ
