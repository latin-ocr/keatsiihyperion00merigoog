60 H YPERION.

Where a sweet clime was breathed from a land ἲ ’
Os fragranee‚ quietness and trees and flowers.

Fnll of calm joys it was, as Ι of grief ;
Τοο full of joy and soft delicious' warmth ;

So that Ι felt a movement in my heart

To chide and to reproach that sohtude

With songs of misery, music of our woes 3

And sate me down, and took a mouthed shell 270
And murmur’d into it, and made melody-

Ο melody no more! sor while Ι sang,

And with poor skill let pass into the breeze

The dull shell’s echo, from a bowery strand

Just opposite, and island of the sea,

Tbere came enchantment with the shifting wind,
That did both drown and keep alive mine ears

I threw my shell away upon the send,

And a wave fill'd it, as my sense was fill’d

With that new blissful golden melody.

A living death was in each gush os sounds,

Each family of rapturous hurried notes,

That fell one aster one, yet all at once,

Like pearl-beads dropping sudden from their string:
And then another, then another strain,
