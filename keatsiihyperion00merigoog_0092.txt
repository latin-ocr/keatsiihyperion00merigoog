80 H YPERION.

These grassy solitudes, and seen the flowers

List up their heads, as still the whisper pass'd.
Goddess! Ι have beheld those eyes before,

And their eternal calm, and all that face, 60
Or I have dreamed.''-“Yes,'' said the supreme shape‚
⁴ “Thou hast dream'd of me, and awaking up

Didst find a lyre all golden by thy side,

Whose strings touch’d by thy fingers, all the vast
Unwearied ear of the whole universe

Listen'd in pain and pleasure at the birth

Of such new tuneful wonder. Is't not strange

That thou should'st weep so' gifted? Tell me, youth,

What sorrow thou canst feel, for I am sad
When thou dost shed a tear: explain thy griefs 70
To one who in this lonely isle hath been

The watcher ol thy sleep and hours of life,
From the young day when first thy infant hand
Pluck'd wn‘tless the weak flowers‚ till thine arm
Could bend that bow heroic to all times.

Show thy heart's secret to an ancient Power
Who hath forsaken old and sacred thrones

For prophecies of thee, and for the sake

Of loveliness new-born.”-Apollo‚ then,
