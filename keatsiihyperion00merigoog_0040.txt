28 H YPERION.

Awaiting for Hyperion’s command.
Fain would he have commanded, fain took throne, 290
And bid the day begin, if but for change.
He might not ; no, though a primeval God:
The sacred seasons might nothe disturb'd.
Therefore the operations of the dawn
Stayd in their birth, even as here 'tis told.
Those silver wings expanded sisterly‚

Eager to sai] their orb 3 the porches wide

Opcn’d upon the dusk demesnes of the night3

And the bright Titan, frenzied with new woes,

Unused to bend, by hard compulsion bent 300
His spirit to the sorrow of the time:

And all along a dismal rack oi clouds,

Upon the boundaries of day and night, ·

He stretch’d himself 'in grief and radiance faint

There, as he lay, the Heaven with its stars

Look’d down on him with pity, and the voice

Of Coelus, from the universal space,
Thus whisper'd low and solemn in his ear.

“O brightest of my children dear, earth-bom
And sky-engender’d‚ Son of mysteries 310
All unrevealed even to the Powers
