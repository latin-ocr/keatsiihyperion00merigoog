20 H YPERJON.

His winged minions in close clusters stood,
Amazed and full of sear ; like anxious men,
Who on wide plains gather in panting troopS,
When earthquakes jar their battlements and towers. 20·

Even now, while Sanun, roused from icy tranee,
Went step for step with Thea through the woods‚
Hyperion, leaving twilight in the rear,
Came slope upon the threshold of the west:
Then‚ as was wont‚ his palace-doors flew ope
In smoothed silence, save what solemn tubes
Blown by the serious Zephyrs gave of sweet
And wandering sounds, slow-breathed melodies:
And like a rose in vermeil tint and shape‚
In fragrance soft and eoolness to the eye, 21
That inlet to severe magnificence
Stood full-blown, for the God to enter in

He entend, but he enterd full of wrath 3
His flaming robes stream'd out beyond his heels,
And gave amar, as if of earthly fire,
That scared away the meek etherea] Hours‚
And made their dove-wings tremble. On he flared,
From stately nave to nave, from vault to vault‚

Through bowers of fragrant and inwreathed light,
