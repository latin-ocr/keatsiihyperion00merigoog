Of shapeless Chaos Say, doth the dull soil
Quarrel with the proud sorests it hath fed,
And feedeth still, more comely than itself?
Can it deny the chiefdom of green groves?
Or shall the tree be envious of the dove
Because it cooeth‚ and hath snowy wings
To wander wherewithal‚ and find its joys?
We are such forest-trees, and our fair boughs
Have bred forth, not pale solitary doves‚
But eagles golden-featherd, who do tower
Above us in their beauty, and must reign

In right thereos : for 'tis the eternal law
That first in beauty should be first in might:
Yea, by that law another race may drive
Our conquerors to mourn, as we do now.

My dispossessor? Have ye seen his face?
Have ye beheld his chariot, foam'd along
By noble winged creatures he hath made?
I saw him on the calmed waters send,
With such a glow of ¹beauty in his eyes,
That it enforced me to bid sad farewell
To all my empire: farewell sad Ι took,
