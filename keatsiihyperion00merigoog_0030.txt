Or prophesyings of the midnight lamp;
But horrors, portion’d to a giant’s nerve,
Ost made Hyperion ache. His palace bright
Bastion’d with pyramids of glowing gold,
And touch’d with shade os bronzed obelisks,
Glared a blood-red through all its thousand courts,
Arches and domes, and fiery galleries: 180
And all its curtains of Aurorian clouds
Flush’d angerly: while sometimes eagles‘ wingS,
Unseen before by Gods or wondering men,
Darken’d the place; and neighing steeds were heard,
Not heard before by Gods or wondering men ,
Also when he would taste the spicy wreaths

ι Of incense, breathed alost from sacred hills,
Instead of sweets his ample palate took

⁵ savour of poisonous brasS, and metal sich.
And so, when harbour'd in the sleepy west, 190
After the full completion of fair day,
For rest divine upon exalted conch,
And slumber in the arms of melody‚
He paced away the pleasant hours of ease
With stride colossal on from hall to hall 3

While sar within each aisle and deep recess
