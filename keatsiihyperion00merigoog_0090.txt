78 Hwnnnrow.

F ull ankle-deep in lilies of the vale.

The nightingale had ceas’d, and a few stars

Were lingering in the heavens, while the thrush
Began calm-throated. Throughout all the isle

There was no covert‚ no retired cave

Unhaunted by the murmurous noise of waves, 40
Though scarcely heard in many a green recess.

He listen'd and he wept‚ and his bright tears

Went trickling down the golden bow he held.

Thus with half-shut suffused eyes he stood,

While from beneath some cumbrous boughs hard by
With solemn step an awful Goddess came,

And there was purport in her looks for him,

Which he with eager guess began to read
Perplexed‚ the while melodiously he said:

“How camest thou over the unfooted sea? 50

Or hath that antique mien and robed form
Moved in these vales invisible till now?

Sure Ι have heard these vestments sweeping o'er
The fallen leaves when Ι have sate alone

In cool mid forest. Surely Ι have traced

The mstle of those ample skirts about .
