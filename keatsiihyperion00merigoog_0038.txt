26 H YPERION. .

I-Ie breathed fierce breath against the sleepy portals,

Cleared them of heavy vapours, burst them wide

Suddenly on the ocean's chilly streams.
The planet-orb of fire whereon he rode
Each day from east to west the heavens through, ²70
Spun round in sable curtaining of clouds;
Not therefore veiled quite, blindfold and hid 3
But ever and anon the glancing sphereS,
Circles and arcs, and broad-belting colure,
Glowd through, and wrought upon the rnuffling dark
Sweet-shaped lightnings from the nadir deep
Up to the zenith 3 hieroglyphics old,
Which suges and keen-eyed astrologers
Then living on the earth, with labouring thought

η Won from the gaze of many centuries: ' 280

Now lost, save what we find on remnants huge

Of stone or marble swa1t3 their import gone,

Their wisdom long since fled. Two wings this orb
Possess'd for glory, two fair argent wings,

· Ever exalted at the God’s approach:

And now from forth the gloom their plumes immense
Rose, one by one, till all outspreaded were3

While still the dazzling globe maintain’d eclipse,
