10 H YPERI ON.

A soft and silken mat for Satum’s feet
One moon, with alteration slow‚ had shed
Her silver seasons four upon the night,
And still these two were postured motionless,
Like natural sculpture in cathedral cavem;
The frozen God still conchant on the earth,
And the sad Goddess weeping at his leet:
Until at length old Satum listed up
His faded eyes, and saw his kingdom gone, 90
And all the gloom and sorrow 01 the place,
And that fair kneeling Goddess3 and then spake
As with a palsied tongue, and while his beard
Shook horrid with such aspen-malady.
“O tender sponse 01 gold Hyperion‚
Thea, I feel thee ere I see thy face ;
Look up, and let me see our doom in it;
Look up, and tell me 11 this feeble shape
Is Satnm's ; tell me, 11 thou hear'st the voice
Of Saturn 3 tell me, if this wrinkling brow‚ 100

- Naked and bare 01 its great diadem,

Peers like the front 01 Saturn. Who had power

To make me desolate? whence came the strength?

How was it nurtured to such bursting forth,
