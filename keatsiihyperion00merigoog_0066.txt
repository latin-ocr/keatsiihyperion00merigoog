Was ripening in itself. The ripe hour came, s

And with it Light‚ and Light engendering ·

Upon its own producer‚ forthwith touch’d

The whole enonnous matter into life.

Upon that very honr, our parentage‚

The Heavens and the Earth were manifest:

Then thou first-bom, and we the giant race, 200

Found ourselves ruling new and beauteous reahns.
’ Now comes the pain of nuth, to whom ’tis pain:

Ο folly! forto bear all naked truths,

And to envisage circumstance, all calm,

This is the top of sovereignty. Mark well!

As Heaven and Earth are fairer‚ fairer far

Than Chaos and blank Darkness, though once chiefs;

And ns we show beyond that Heaven and Earth

In form and shape, compa& and beautiful,

In will, in attion free, companionship‚

And thousand other signs of purer life3

So on our heels a fresh perfectiori treads,

A power more strong in beauty‚ born of us

And fated to excel us'‚ as we pass

In glory that old Darkness: nor are we

Thereby more conquer'd than by us the rule
