²4 H YPERJON.

Even here, into my eentre of repose‚

The shady visions come to domineer‚

Insult and blind, and stifle up my pomp.

Fall! n0‚ by Tellus and her briny robes!

Over the fiery frontier of my realms

I will advance a terrible right ann

Shall seare that infant Thunderer, rebel Jove,

And bid old Satum take his throne again.” 250
He spake and ceased the while a heavier threat

Held struggle with his throat, but carne not forth:

For as in theatres of crowded men

Hubbub increases more they call out “Hush!”

So at Hyperion’s words the phantoms pale

Bestin’d themselves, thrice horrible and cold ;

And from the mirror'd level where he stood

A mist arose, as from a scummy marsh.

Atthis through all his bulk an agony

Crept gradual, from the feet unto the crown, 260

Like a lithe serpent vast and muscular,

Making slow way, with head and neck eonvuls’d

With overfstrained might. Releas’d he fled

To the eastern gates, and full six dewy hours

Before the dawn in season due should blush,
