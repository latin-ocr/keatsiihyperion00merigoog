And hither came to'see how dolorous fate ’ 240
Had wrought upon ye3 and how Ι might best
Give consolation in this woe extreme.
Receive the truth, and let it be your bahn”
Whether through posed convidtion or disdain,
Tbey guarded silence, when Oceanus
Lest murmuring, what deepest thought can tell?
But so it was, none answerd for a space, ,
Save one whom none regarded, Clymene:
And yet she answer’d not, only complain'd,
With hedlic lips, and eyes uplooking mild, 250
Thus wording timidly among the derce:

“0 Father, Ι am here the simplest voice,

And all my knowledge is that j0y is gone,

And this thing woe crept in among our hearts,

There to remain sor ever, as Ι sear.

Ι would not bode of evil, if Ι thought

So weak a creature could turn off the help

Which by just right should come of mighty Gods;

Yet let me tell my sorrow, let me tell

of what Ι heard, and how it made me weep, 260

And know that we had parted from all hope.
Ι stood upon a shore, a pleasant shore,
