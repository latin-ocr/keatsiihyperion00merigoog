Palm-shaded temples, and high rival sanes
By Oxus, or in Ganges’ sacred isles.

Even as Hope upon her anchor leans,

So *leant she, not so fair, upon a tusk

Shed from the broadest of her elephants.
Above her, on a crag's uneasy shelf,

Upon his elbow rais’d, all prostrate else, ·
Shadow'd Enceladus; once tame and mild,

As grazing ox unworried in the meads;

Now tiger-passion'd, lion-thoughted, wroth,

He meditated, plotted, and even now·

'Was hurling mountains in that second war, 70
Not long delayd, that scared the younger Gods

To hide themselves in forms of beast and bird.

Not far hence Atlas 3 and beside him prone

Phorcus, the sire of Gorgons. Neighbourd close
Oceanus, and Tethys, in whose lap

Sobb'd Clymene among her tangled hair.

In midst of all lay Themis, at the feet

Of Ops the queen all clouded round from sight;

No shape distinguishable, more than when
