66 H YPERIOM

Ο let him feel the evil he· hath done:
For, though I scom Oceanus’s lore,
Much pain have Ι for more than loss of realms:
The days of peace and slumberous calm are fled;
Th0se days, all innocent of scathing war, .
When all the fair Existences of heaven
Came open-eyed to guess what we would speak :-
That was before our brows were taught to frown,
Before our lips knew else but solemn sounds3 340
That was before we knew the wringed thing,
Vitiory might be lost, or might be won.
And be ye mindful that' Hyperion‚
Our brightest brother, still is undisgraced.-
Hypenbn, lo! his radiante is here!”

All eyes were on Enceladns’s face,
And they beheld, while still Hyperion’s name
Flew from his lips up to the vaulted rocks,
A pallid gleam across his features stem:

Not savage, for he saw full many a God 350
Wroth as himself. He look’d upon them all,
And in each fane he saw a gleam of light,

But splendider in Satum's‚ whose hoar locks

¹ Shone like the bubbling foam about a keel,
