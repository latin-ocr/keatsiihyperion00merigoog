30 HVPERIOM

Which met at thy creating! at whose joys
And palpitations sweet and pleasures solt,

I Coelus wonder how they came and whence ;
And at the fruits thereos what shapes they be,
Distinet and visible3 symbols divine, ’

Manifestations of that beauteous life

Diffused unseen throughout eternal space 3

Of these new-form'd art thou, Ο brightest child!

Of these thy brethren and the goddesses. 3²0
There is sad seud among ye, and rebellion

Of son against his sire. 1 saw him fall,

Ι saw my first-bom tumbled from his throne!

To me his arms were spread, to me his voice

Found way from forth the thunders round his head!
Pale wox I, and in vapours hid my face.

Art thou, too, near such doom? vague fear there is:
For 1 have seen my sons most unlike Gods.

Divine ye were created, and divine

In sad demeanour, solemn, undisturb'd‚ 330
Umuffled‚ like high Gods, ye lived and ruled:

Now I behold in you sear, hope, and wrath ,·

Actions of rage and passion ; even as

Ι see thern in the mortal world hemath,
