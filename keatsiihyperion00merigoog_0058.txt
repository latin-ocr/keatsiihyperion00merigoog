46 HYPERJOM

Is persecuted more, and feverd more,

When it is nighing to the moumful house

Where other hearts are sick of the same bruise 5

So Saturn, as he walk’d into the midst,

Felt faint, and would have. sunk among the rest, ¹

But that he met Enceladus's eye,

Whose mightiness, and awe of him, at once

Came like an inspiration ; and he shouted,

“TitanS, behold your Godt” at which some groan’d3 110
Some started on their feet ; some also shouted ;

Some wept, some wail’d3 all bow’d with reverence:

And Ops, uplifting her black folded veil,

Show’d her pale cheeks‚ and all her sorehead wan,

Her eyebrows thin and J‘et, and hollow eyes.
There is a roaring in the bleak-grown pines

When winter lifts his voice3 there is a noise.

Among immortals, when a God gives sign,

With hushing finger, how he means to load

His tongne with the full weight of utterless thought, 120

With thunder, and with music, and with pomp:

Such noise is like the roar of bleak-grown pines 3⁴

Which, when it ceasesin this mountain'd world,

No other sound succeeds3 but ceasing here,
