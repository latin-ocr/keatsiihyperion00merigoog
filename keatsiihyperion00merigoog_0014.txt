HYPERION

Boos< THE ΗΜ

’ἢ ΕΕΡ in ‘the shady sadness of a vale

Α Far sunken from the healthy breath of morn,

Far from the fiery noon‚ and eve’s one star,
sate grey-haird saturn, quiet as a stone,
Still as the silence round about his lair ;
Forest on forest hung about his head
, Like cloud on cloud. No stir of air was there,
Not so much life as on a summer’s day
Robs not one light seed from the seather’d grass 5
But where the dead leaf fell, there did it rest. 10
A stream went voiceless by, still deaden’d more
By reason of his fallen divinity
