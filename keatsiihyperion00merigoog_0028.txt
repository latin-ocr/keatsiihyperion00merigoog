16 H YPERION.

Ο Saturn, come away, and give them heart3

I know the covert, for thence came I hither.‘'

Thus brief ; then with beseeching eyes she went

With backward footing through the shade a space:

He follow'd, and she turned to lead the way

Through aged boughs, that yielded like the mist

Which eagles eleave, upmounting from their nest.
Meanwhile in other realms big tears were shed,

More sorrow like to this, and such like woe‚

Τοο huge for mortal tongue, or pen of scribe. 160

The Titans fierce, sels-hid or prison-bound,

Groan'd for.the old allegiance once more,

And listen’d in sharp pain for Satum’s voice.

But one of the whole mammoth-brood still kept

His sovereignty and mle and majesty.

Blazing Hyperion on his orbed fire

Still sate, still snuff’d the incense, teeming up

From man to the sun’s God, yet unsecure:

For as among us mortals omens drear

Fright and perplex‚ so also shuddetd he ; 170
Not at dog¹s howl, or gloom-bird's hated screech,

Or the familiar visiting of one

Upon the first toll of the passing-bell,
