4 HYPERIOM

,Spreading a shade: the Naiad ’mid her reeds
Press’d her cold finger closer to her lips.
Along the margin-saud large footmarks went,
No farther than to where his feet had stray’d‚
And slept there since. Upon the sodden ground
His old right hand lay nerveless, listless, dead,
Unsceptred3 and his realmless eyes were closed3
While his bow’d head seem’d listening to the Earth, 20
His ancient mother, for some comfort yet.

It seem’d no force could wake him from his place;

But there came one, who with a kindred hand
Touch’d his wide shoulders‚ after bending low
With reverence, though to one who knew it not
She was a Goddess of the infant world;

By her iu stature the tall Amazon

Had stood a pigmy's height: she would have ta’en
Achilles by the hair and bent his neck3

, Or with a finger stay'd Ixion’s wheel. 30
Her face was large as that of Memphian Sphinx,
Pedestal'd haply in a palace-court,

When sages look’d to Egypt for their lore.

But oh! how unlike marble was that face:

How beautiful! if sorrow had not made
