8 HYPERION.

Is emptied of thy hoary majesty.
Thy thunder, eonscious of the new command,
Rumbles reluffltnt 0’er our fallen house;
And thy sharp lightning in unpradtis'd hands
Scorches and burns our once serene domain.
O aching time, Ο moments big as years!
All as ye pass swell out the monstrous truth,
And press it so upon our weary griefs‚
'that unbelief has not a space to breathe.
Saturn, sleep on :-0 thoughtless‚ why did I
Thus violate thy slumbrous solitude?
Why should I ope thy melancholy eyes?
Satum, sleep on! while at thy feet 1 weep.”
As when, upon a tranced summer-night,
Th0se green-robed senators of mighty woods,

‘r'all oaks, branehehanned by the eamest stars‚

Dream, aud so dream all night without a stir,

Save from one gradus] solitary gust

Which comes upon the silence, and dies off,

As if the ebbing air had but one wave 3

So came these words and went: the while in tears

She touch’d her fair large forehead to the gtound, 80
. Just where her falling hair might be outspread
