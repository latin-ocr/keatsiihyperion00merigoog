62 HYPERION.

Each like a dove, leaving its olive-perch,
With music wing'd instead os silent plumes,
To hover round my head, and make me sick

Of j0y and grief at once. Grief overcame,

And Ι was stopping up my frantie ears, ²90
When, past all hindrance of my trembling hands,

A voice camesweeter, sweeter than all tune,

And still it cried, ‘Apollol young Apollo!'

‘The morning bright Apollo l' ‘young Apollo l’

I fled3 it follow’d me, and cn'ed, ‘Apollo!'

Ο Father and 0 Brethren‚ had ye felt

Those painsos mine! Ο Satum, hadst thou felt,

Ye would not call this too indulged tongue

Presumptuous‚ in thus ventun'ng to be heard” ¹ v
So sar her voice flow'd on, like timorous brook 300

That lingering along a pebbled coast

Doth sear to meet -the sea: but sea it met

And shudder’d3 for the overwhelming voice ·

Of huge Enceladus swallow'd itin wrath:

The ponderous syllables, like sullen waves

In the half-glutted hollows of roes-rocks,

Came booming thus, while still upon his arm .

He leant not rising from supreme contempt.
