- 38 nmmos.

And thus in thousand hugest phantasies
Made a fit roofing to this nest of woe.
Instead of thrones hard flint they sate upon,
Conches of mgged stone, and slaty ridge
Stubbom'd with iron. ΑΗ were not assembled:
Some chain’d in torture, and some wandering.
Caeus, and Gyges, and Briareiis,
Typhon, and Dolor, and Porphyrion,

- With many more, the bmwniest in assault,
Were pent in regions of lahorious brenth5

Dungeon’d in opaque element to keep
Tbeir clenched teeth still clench'd, and all their limbs

Lock’d up in veins of metnl, ¹cmmp'd and screw'd 3 .
Without a motion, save of their big hearts
Heaving in pain, and honibly convuls’d

With sanguine, feverous, boiling gurge of puise.
Mnemosyne was straying in the world3

Far from her moon had Phoebe wandered3 30
And many else were free to roam abroad3

But for the main here found they covert drear.

Scarce images of life, one here, one there,

Lay vast and edgeways3 like va dismal cirque

Of Dmid stones‚ upon a forlom moor,
