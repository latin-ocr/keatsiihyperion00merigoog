7⁶ mnemon

In aid soft warble from the Dorian flute ;

For lo! ’tis for the Father of all verse.

Flush everything that hath a vermeil hue,

Let the rose glow intense and warm the air,

And let the clouds of even and of mom

Float in voluptuous fleeces o’er the hills ;

Let the red wine within the goblet boil‚

Cold as abubblingwe113 let faint-lipp’d shells‚

On sandS, or in great deeps‚ vermilion turn 20
Through all their labyrinths ; and let the maid
Blush keenly, as with some warm kiss surpris’d.
Chief island of the embower’d CycladeS,

Rejoice‚ Ο Delos, with thine olives green,

And poplars, and lawn-shading palms, and beeeh
In which the Zephyr brenthes the loudest song, '
And hazels thick, dark-stemm'd beneath the shade:
Apollo is once more the golden theme!

Where was he when the Giant of the Sun

Stood bright amid the sorrow os his peers? 30
Together had he left his mother sair

And his twin-sister sleeping in their bower,
And in the morning twilight wandex'd forth
Beside the osiers ofa rivulo,
