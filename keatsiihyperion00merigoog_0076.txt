“Or shall we hsten to the over-wise,
Or to the over-foohsh giant, Gods?
Not thunderbolt on thunderbolt titt all
That rebel Jove’s whole armoury were spent,
Not world on world upon these shoulders piled,

Could agonize me more than baby-words

In midst of this dethronement horrible.

Speak! 'roarl shout! yell! ye sleepy Titane alh
Do ye forget the blows, the buffets vilet·

Are ye not smitten by a youngling arm?

Dost thou sor'get, sham monarch of the waves‚
Thy scalding in the seas? What! have Ι roused 320

, Your spleens with so few simple words as these?

O joy! for now I see ye are not lost:
Ο joy! for now I see a thousand eyes
wide-glanng for revenge.'’-As this he said,
He lifted up his stature vast, and stood,
Still without intermission speaking thus:
“Now ye are flames, I’ll tell you how to burn,
And purge the ether os our enemies 3
How to feed fierce the crooked stings of fite,
And singe away the swollen clouds of Jove, 330
Stifling that puny essence in his tent
