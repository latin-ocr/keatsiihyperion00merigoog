22 H YPERJON.

And diamond-paved, lustrous, long arcades, 220
Until he reached the great main cupola

There standing fierce hemath, he stamp’d his foot‚

And from the basements deep to the high towers

Jarr'd his own golden region: and before

The quavering thunder thereupon had ceased, ’

His voice leapt out, despite of godlike airh,

To this result: “O dreams of day and night!
Omonstrous forms, Ο effigies of pain!

Ο ερεέὶτεε busy in a cold, cold glooml

O lankear'd phantoms of black-weeded pools! 230
Why do I knowtye? why have Ι seen ye? why

Is my eternal essence thus distraught,

To see and to behold these horrors new?

Satum is fallen, am Ι too to fall?

Am I to leave this haven of my rest, ι

rhis cradle of my glory, this soft clime‚

This calm luxuriante of blissful light,

These crystalline pavilionS, and pure fanes

, Of all my lucent Empire? Itis left

Deserted, void, nor any haunt of mine.

The blaze, the splendour‚ and the symmetry‚

Ι cannot see, but darkness death and darkness.
